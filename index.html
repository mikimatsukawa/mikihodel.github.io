      HRM multiplex real-time PCR detection of Salmonella virulence and ESBL resistance genes in food
    </h4>
    <p>
      Salmonella is a gram-negative bacterium comprised of two species and 2,500 serotypes. The World Health Organization estimates that each year, there are 78.8 million cases of non-typhoidal salmonellosis caused by contaminated food and water.  Currently, several antibiotics are used to treat salmonellosis.  However, due to the overuse of antibiotics in human medicine and animal husbandry, and horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from closely related enteric bacteria, resistance in Salmonella has become an emerging public health concern.  Extended spectrum beta lactamase is an enzyme that confers resistance to extended spectrum beta-lactam (ESBL) antibiotics, a last resort antibiotic class with high medical value.  In MU’s Food Science Program, Dr. Mustapha’s research group is developing a technique that uses a high resolution melt-curve (HRM) multiplex real-time (RT)-PCR assay to detect ESBL resistance genes in Salmonella from contaminated food. HRM RT-PCR is suitable for virulent ESBL-resistant Salmonella detection because results can be obtained faster than is achievable by conventional PCR, multiple target genes can be detected in one assay, and there is a low occurrence of false positive results. The HRM RT-PCR assay in development targets nine different genes that includes the virulence genes associated with Salmonella infections and ESBL resistance genes. The assay is being applied to detect these genes in a variety of food samples that have been associated with foodborne salmonellosis.

      Understanding Macrophage Polarization in the Presence of Apoptotic Neutrophils
    </h4>
    <p>
      Understanding the polarization of macrophages, a type of white blood cell, is useful to the study of immune response during infection. Traditionally, macrophages have been categorized into two polar phenotypes, M1 and M2. M1 macrophages are known as pro-inflammatory cells, while M2 macrophages encourage resolution of inflammation and promote wound healing. M1 and M2 phenotypes can be differentiated by the cytokines, small signaling proteins, released by each phenotype. M1 cells produce the cytokine TNF-alpha while M2 cells produce Interleukin-10. In addition, macrophage polarity can also be distinguished by their production of nitric oxide metabolites, with M1 cells using inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and M2 using arginase.  Lyme Disease is a common infectious disease spread by the bite of an infected tick carrying the bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi. Using this Lyme Disease model of infection, we can study the immune response of the macrophage cell against a pathogen. In past research by the Brown lab, in vitro infection of macrophages with, Borrelia burgdorferi resulted in the expression of the M1 phenotype. However, in the joints of the B. burgdorferi infected mouse, the M2 phenotype outnumbered the M1 phenotype by 100-fold. Thus, there is a distinct contrast in phenotypic macrophage expression between in vitro and in vivo B. burgdorferi infections.  This research is being conducted by an in vitro infection of wild type macrophages to measure the polarizing effect of apoptotic neutrophils’ presence. The apoptotic neutrophils from wild type and BLT-1 knockout mice were used. BLT-1 is a cell surface receptor for Leukotriene B4, a fatty acid involved in the regulation of inflammation. The macrophages were first activated with Borrelia burgdorferi in the presence of apoptotic neutrophils. Then, the macrophages were harvested, and the supernatants assayed for nitric oxide. We expected that administration of apoptotic wild type neutrophils will induce Interleukin-10 production while decreasing TNF-alpha production, leading to a M2 phenotype and that apoptotic BLT-1 knockout neutrophils, known to be defective in inducing IL-10 cytokine, to polarize macrophages to M1 cells. However, our results indicates that both wild type and apoptotic BLT-1 knockout neutrophils polarize macrophages to M2. A future in vivo study will be necessary to determine the function of apoptotic neutrophils on macrophage phenotype in the live animal.

      Improving gene editing via soybean hairy root transformation using different promoters to express Cas9
    </h4>
    <p>
      The rhizobium-legume symbiosis is an interesting research topic at several levels from physiology to molecular biology. Genetic screens using large mutated populations have been useful in uncovering key genes involved in the early and late stages of nodule development. However, this approach is laborious and costly. The recent introduction of CRISPR/Cas technology is revolutionizing biology by allowing targeted editing of the genome. The M. Stacey laboratory has recently developed and deployed the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system via Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated hairy root transformation in order to study gene function in soybean roots, including root nodules. This system is highly efficient, with up to 70% of the transgenic roots having a homozygous mutation in the targeted gene. The aim of our study is to improve the efficiency of this CRISPR/Cas system through modifying the promoter sequence that drives the Cas9 protein. We acquired three constitutive promoters, Cauliflower mosaic virus (35S), Cassava vein mosaic virus (CvMV), and soybean native promoter Ubiquitin (GmUBQ). These promoters are highly expressed in soybean roots and nodules. Constructs were made in which each of these promoters was used to drive transcription of the nuclease Cas9 along with guide RNA directed toward nodule uricase (UOX) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) as target genes. Consistent with previous results, 70% of the transgenic roots generated from the 35S promoter were unable to fix N2 as exemplified by their lack of leghemoglobin production. We are currently analyzing hairy roots made using the other promoters but, based on preliminary results, expect a higher success rate.  Our study further validates the utility of using the CRISPR/Cas9 in soybean hairy roots and, hopefully, will improve the system further to facilitate a wide range of studies related to soybean roots and the associated nitrogen fixing symbiosis.
